# SimpleNaturalLanguageProcessor_usingC

This is a Simple Natural Language Processor implemented in C Language.

The program gives the user two (2) options on how to input text that the program will parse:
- typing in the actual text
- reading it from a text file

After processing, the user will be able to display the probability distribution of the succeeding token for each of the token parsed from the input text.

The program can also generate an output text using the probabilities gathered earlier with the number of words/tokens as user input.

The tokens were stored along with the probabilities using dynamically allocated linked lists.
